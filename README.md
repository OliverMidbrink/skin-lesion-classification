### Abstract
In this work, a machine learning model developed using information and datasets from the internet will be used for diagnosing skin lesions. The goal is to see if making diagnoses is possible using the ISIC Archive and a VGG16 neural network. The model is fed a dermoscopic image of a skin lesion, then categorizes the image into one of the 18 diagnoses available. As the results show, this method of diagnosis significantly outperforms the act of randomly selecting a category. The best attempt, out of five in total, outperforms random diagnostic accuracy by a factor of 5.4, reaching an average of 44.5% of predictions correct on the first try. Although this method does not perform as well as educated dermatologists or state-of-the-art neural networks, it gives an indication towards the right diagnosis. Thereby, serving the purpose of this study by showing that a machine learning model capable of diagnosing skin lesions can be created using information from the internet. An application of this software could be, for example, an app that the average person can use when investigating a suspicious skin lesion on their body.
